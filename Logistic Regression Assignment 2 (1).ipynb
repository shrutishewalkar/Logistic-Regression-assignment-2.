    "Ans Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Grid search is often used in conjunction with cross-validation, a technique used to evaluate a model's performance on an independent data set.\n",

    "Ans: Grid search involves defining a range of values for each hyperparameter and evaluating all possible combinations of these hyperparameters using cross-validation.

If the number of hyperparameters is small and the range of values for each hyperparameter is also small, grid search might be a good option.

    "\n",
    "Split data into training, validation, and test sets: It is essential to split the data into separate sets for training, validation, and testing.

    "\n",
    "Avoid using future data for training: When working with time series data, it is important to ensure that the model is not trained on future data that would not be available during model deployment. One way to prevent this is to use a rolling window approach, where the model is trained on data up to a certain point in time and tested on data from a later time period."
